# Authentication Attacks 

## FUFF

```
fuff -request file.txt -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt -mc 200
```

Notes:
  - this particular script is fuzzing against login passwords
  - `-request` specifies the file that has the request header copied from burp suite
  - `-w` specifies the wordlist
  - `-mc` only outputs response that has a code 200
